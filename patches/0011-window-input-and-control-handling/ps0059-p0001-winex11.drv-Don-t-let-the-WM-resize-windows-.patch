Subject: [PATCH v2 1/2] winex11.drv: Don't let the WM resize windows larger than the work area.

On Windows, Windows with WS_THICKFRAME can be resized and can be larger
than the work area, if shown afterwards. However, it does not resize them
to fit the work area, but keeps them at that large size.

WMs on the other hand will try to resize the window if they can so that they
fit in the work area, even if the window was larger prior. This generates
ConfigureNotify events, and the window will receive size change messages after
wine's X11 driver handles it, breaking some apps which don't expect them.

The caveat is that this will prevent the user from resizing the window
(by e.g. dragging the corner), unlike on Windows. However, in practice,
it's often hard to resize such large windows anyway.

Maybe a registry option would be more appropriate? Otherwise, some apps
will always crash when managed by the WM.
