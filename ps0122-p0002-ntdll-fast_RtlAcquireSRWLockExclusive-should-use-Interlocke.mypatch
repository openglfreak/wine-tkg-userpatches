Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ntdll: fast_RtlAcquireSRWLockExclusive should use
 InterlockedExchangeAdd

Under contention, fast_RtlAcquireSRWLockExclusive can use multiple
atomic operations when trying to increment. However, we could just use
InterlockedExchangeAdd and let the hardware deal with it. This should be
slightly faster.

This micro-optimization opportunity was found by Chris Robinson in
\#winehackers on freenode IRC. We iterated on it until we had a patch we
both liked.
