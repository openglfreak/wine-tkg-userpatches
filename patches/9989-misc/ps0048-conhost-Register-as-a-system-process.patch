Subject: [RFC PATCH] conhost: Register as a system process.

I wrote a program called winestreamproxy [1] that proxys data between a
named pipe in Wine and a unix domain socket outside of Wine. This program
should automatically exit when no other non-system program is running in the
bottle/prefix if the parameter --system is supplied. For this purpose it marks
itself as a system process using __wine_make_process_system() from ntdll, and
waits on the returned event handle to exit.

This worked fine, until a change was introduced that seemingly made every
non-system process spawn a conhost.exe instance. Since conhost.exe is not
a system process, this breaks the auto-exit functionality of winestreamproxy.
I understand that using Wine-internal functions is not supported, however
the desired behavior seems hard if not impossible to implement otherwise.

Making conhost mark itself as a system process would allow the automatic exit
to work again. I don't think this would break anything, because at the point
in the bottle/prefix lifecycle where this becomes relevant there are no
non-system processes anymore, and anything else has either explicitly opted
into this behavior or not received a conhost instance in the first place.

As to why winestreamproxy is necessary at all: It allows Windows games running
under Wine to communicate with Linux-native Discord [2] and show status
messages and invite buttons on a user's profile.
