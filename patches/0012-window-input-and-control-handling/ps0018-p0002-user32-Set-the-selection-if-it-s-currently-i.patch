Don't skip MoveCaret if it would actually change the selection when it is
invalid. This can happen, for example, in a combo box if the dropdown is shown
by a mouse click + release followed by the mouse being moved into the dropped
listbox, when the listbox has nothing selected. In this case, the item with
the index zero would not be selected the first time the mouse moves over it,
since the focus_item would be zero, despite the fact the item is not selected.
