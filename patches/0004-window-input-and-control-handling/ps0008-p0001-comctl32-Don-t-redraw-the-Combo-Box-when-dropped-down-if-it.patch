Subject: [PATCH resend 1/2] comctl32: Don't redraw the Combo Box when dropped down if it has an editbox.
Message-Id: <6508e5f7d1bba3e86c98d9fbe329450a7725d4f7.1606394081.git.gabrielopcode@gmail.com>

Some applications subclass the combo box and handle WM_ERASEBKGND themselves,
without using WS_CLIPCHILDREN. This causes them to erase over the editbox
child. There's no reason to redraw it in this case since the editbox is
supposed to cover it, anyway.
