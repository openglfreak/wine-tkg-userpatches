Subject: [PATCH] conhost: Fix status for READ_CONSOLE ioctl
Message-Id: <Ycx6T+/FtXr14Bid@juliacomputing.com>
Date: Wed, 29 Dec 2021 10:10:07 -0500

Without this patch conhost would attempt to process non-existent input,
spewing stdout with various cursor moves and incorrectly returning
the ReadConsole call early. Fix that by only attempting input processing
if there are actually input records to be processed and properly
returning STATUS_PENDING if the input processing is not yet complete.
