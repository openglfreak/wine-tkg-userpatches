Some programs parse this string to get the Windows version!

cmd seems to use the same string for "cmd /c ver" and the first line of 
"cmd /?".

On Windows 10 neither string is translated in the locales I checked 
(French, Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew). That does not prove it's never 
translated but it does look like it isn't.

So maybe that justifies moving the string out of the resource file so it 
does not appear in the PO files. If so I can resubmit a modified 
version.
