Subject: [PATCH] winebuild: Rename delay import libs .text$2 section to .data$2.
Message-Id: <20211022122252.1807718-1-rbernon@codeweavers.com>

GNU dlltool outputs the DELAY_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR of delay import libs in
a .text$2 section, which is then merged into .text and changes its flags
to add the DATA flag.

This is incorrect and breaks some DRMs, which are then validating that
.text sections doesn't have the IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA flag set.

This is actually more some kind of RFC, as I'm not sure at all what this
change really implies and why the descriptor has to be in .text in the
first place. It seems like some GNU specific thing, as it seems from
internet comments that MSVC places the descriptor in .data section?

As far as I could test, this works fine and removes the incorrect
IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA flag from .text section of DLLs with
delay imports. Also, changing instead the .text$2 section flags to mark
it as code instead doesn't work.

In Proton we have some post-processing step to remove that flag, and I
think it was required by Forza Horizon 4 DRM.
