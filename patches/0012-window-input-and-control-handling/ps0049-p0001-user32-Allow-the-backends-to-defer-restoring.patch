Subject: [PATCH 1/2] user32: Allow the backends to defer restoring minimized
 windows.

When restoring a minimized window the WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_RESTORE message
should arrive after WM_NCACTIVATE but before WM_ACTIVATE and WM_SETFOCUS.

Some games depend on that ordering and the related window state.

For example Project CARS 3 expects window to be both active and in the
foreground (wrt GetActiveWindow() and GetForegroundWindow()) when
receiving those messages.

Without being active the window doesn't restore properly, see
82c6ec3a32f4 ("winex11.drv: Activate window when restoring from iconic state.")

But if the activate messages arrive before the window is in the
foreground, the game tries to re-acquire DirectInput DISCL_FOREGROUND
devices too early and fails, which results in non-working keyboards and
controllers.
