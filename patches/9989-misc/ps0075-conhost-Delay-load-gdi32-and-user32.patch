Subject: [PATCH] conhost: Delay-load gdi32 and user32.

Both do some nontrivial work on DLL initialization, and conhost may quite
likely never need to display UI.

Actually gdi32 initialization is quite cheap now, at least on my machine,
though user32 still takes over 100 ms. In truth the annoyance for me was not
so much startup time as pollution of +server logs.
